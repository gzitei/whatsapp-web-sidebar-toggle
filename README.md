Hide/show the WhatsApp Web sidebar.

At times, you may find the need to share your screen to display a specific WhatsApp chat using the web version of the app. However, you might not want to expose all your other chats visible in the sidebar. To address this problem, this extension lets you toggle the visibility of the WhatsApp Web sidebar allowing you to focus only on the chat you wish to display, without having to worry about messages from other chats you don't want to share.

Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + S
